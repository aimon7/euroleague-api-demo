# Advanced Stats — Methodology (Tier A)

This document is the methodology sheet for the advanced basketball statistics surfaced in `euroleague-api-demo`. The app computes these client-side ("in flight") from box-score totals returned by the `euroleague-api` SDK. Every metric in the UI is marked as one of:

- **`From API`** — already returned by the SDK's `type: "advanced"` stats and shown verbatim.
- **`Calculated`** — computed by this app from traditional box-score totals.

> **Implementation note.** The implementation lives in `src/lib/advanced/`. Each metric is exposed as an object of the shape `{ key, label, value, source: 'api' | 'computed', formula, reference }`, so the UI can render the value, label it `From API` / `Calculated`, and link to its reference. **Minutes-unit scaling** (per-game decimal vs accumulated seconds/minutes) is reconciled in code before any minutes-dependent formula runs, so all of `MP`, `TmMP`, etc. share a consistent unit.

## Inputs

The formulas below draw on box-score totals exposed by the SDK:

- **Player season totals** — `players.getStats({ type: "traditional", mode: "Accumulated" })`.
- **Team totals** — `teams.getStats({ type: "traditional", mode: "Accumulated" })`.
- **Opponent totals** — `teams.getStats({ type: "opponentsTraditional", mode: "Accumulated" })`.
- **Team advanced set** (`From API`) — `teams.getStats({ type: "advanced", mode: "Accumulated" })`, which the API returns directly: **eFG%, TS%, OREB%/DREB%/REB%, AST/TO, assistsRatio, turnoversRatio, twoPointRate, threePointRate, freeThrowsRate, and points distribution**. These are shown as `From API`.

## Abbreviations

| Abbr. | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| FGM / FGA | Field goals made / attempted (total) |
| 3PM / 3PA | Three-pointers made / attempted |
| FTM / FTA | Free throws made / attempted |
| PTS | Points |
| OREB / DREB / TRB | Offensive / defensive / total rebounds |
| AST | Assists |
| STL | Steals |
| BLK | Blocks |
| TOV | Turnovers |
| PF | Personal fouls |
| MP | Minutes played |
| `Tm*` | The player's **team** totals (e.g. `TmFGA`, `TmMP`) |
| `Opp*` | **Opponents'** totals (e.g. `OppDREB`, `OppPoss`) |
| Poss | Possessions (see Team metrics) |

`TmMP/5` converts team minutes into team **player-minutes per position slot** (a five-player floor), which is the standard denominator basis for the percentage metrics below.

## Team Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Possessions (Poss) | `0.5 * ((FGA - OREB + TOV + 0.44*FTA) + (OppFGA - OppOREB + OppTOV + 0.44*OppFTA))` | Calculated |
| Pace | `40 * Poss / (TmMP/5)` | Calculated |
| Offensive Rating (ORtg) | `100 * PTS / Poss` | Calculated |
| Defensive Rating (DRtg) | `100 * OppPTS / OppPoss` | Calculated |
| Net Rating | `ORtg - DRtg` | Calculated |

### Team metric details

- **Possessions** — A symmetric estimate that averages the team's and opponents' possession counts. Inputs: `FGA`, `OREB`, `TOV`, `FTA` and their `Opp*` counterparts. Reference: [Basketball-Reference ratings](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html).
- **Pace** — Possessions per 40 minutes of play (EuroLeague game length). Inputs: `Poss`, `TmMP`. Reference: [Basketball-Reference ratings](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html).
- **Offensive Rating (ORtg)** — Points scored per 100 possessions. Inputs: `PTS`, `Poss`. Reference: [Basketball-Reference ratings](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html).
- **Defensive Rating (DRtg)** — Points allowed per 100 opponent possessions. Inputs: `OppPTS`, `OppPoss`. Reference: [Basketball-Reference ratings](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html).
- **Net Rating** — Point differential per 100 possessions. Inputs: `ORtg`, `DRtg`. Reference: [Basketball-Reference ratings](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ratings.html).

### Four Factors

| Factor | Formula | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| eFG% | `(FGM + 0.5*3PM) / FGA` | From API |
| TOV% | `TOV / Poss` | Calculated |
| OREB% | `OREB / (OREB + OppDREB)` | From API or Calculated |
| FT Rate | `FTM / FGA` | From API |

The "Four Factors" are Dean Oliver's four core determinants of winning (shooting, turnovers, rebounding, free throws). Where the API's `type: "advanced"` team set already provides the factor (eFG%, OREB%, FT-related rate), the app shows it as `From API`; otherwise it computes it. Team `TOV%` here uses the possession-based denominator (`TOV / Poss`) rather than the player-level denominator used above.

## Excluded (and why)

The following advanced metrics are **intentionally NOT implemented**:

- **RAPM** (Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus)
- **RPM** (Real Plus-Minus)
- **RAPM-based BPM** (a "real" BPM derived from RAPM)
- **Official Win Shares**

These require full-league **play-by-play stint data** plus **ridge regression** and **EuroLeague-tuned coefficients** that are not publicly available. They cannot be computed reliably from box-score totals in a static, client-side browser app, so presenting them would mean presenting something that is neither accurate nor reproducible.
